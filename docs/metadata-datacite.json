      "description": "This dataset integrates behavioral health indicators from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) with age-adjusted colorectal cancer incidence rates from the U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS) registry via CDC WONDER. The curated dataset includes state-level prevalence of obesity, smoking, and corresponding colon and rectum cancer incidence for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The dataset was produced as part of a data curation workflow involving extraction, cleaning, harmonization, and integration of heterogeneous public health sources. Raw BRFSS and USCS data are not redistributed due to CDC licensing restrictions; users must obtain the raw data directly from the original sources."
