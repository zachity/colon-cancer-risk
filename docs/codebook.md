| `State`              | string  | N/A                                         | Full state name (e.g., `Illinois`, `California`, `District of Columbia`).                          | 51 distinct values                            | Derived (BRFSS/USCS match)  |
| `Abbrev`             | string  | N/A                                         | Two-letter USPS state abbreviation (e.g., `IL`, `CA`, `DC`).                                       | 51 distinct values                            | Derived (BRFSS/USCS match)  |
| `obesity_rate`       | float   | Percent (%) of adult population             | Weighted prevalence of adults (18+) with BMI ≥ 30 in 2022, computed from BRFSS survey weights.     | Typically 20–45                               | BRFSS 2022 (`_OBESITY3`)    |
| `smoking_rate`       | float   | Percent (%) of adult population             | Weighted prevalence of adults who report smoking every day or some days in 2022.                   | Typically 8–25                                | BRFSS 2022 (`_RFSMOK3`)     |
| `incidence_rate_adj` | float   | Cases per 100,000 population (age-adjusted) | Age-adjusted incidence rate of colon and rectum cancer for 2022, per 100,000 persons.             | Typically 30–55                               | USCS 2022 via CDC WONDER    |

## 2. Dataset-Level Notes

- **Unit of observation:** U.S. state (50 states + District of Columbia).  
- **Year covered:** 2022 only (both BRFSS and USCS slices).  
- **Population:** Non-institutionalized adults (BRFSS) and all reportable cancer cases (USCS).  

### 2.1 Handling of Missing and Suppressed Values

- BRFSS records with invalid or missing values in `_OBESITY3` or `_RFSMOK3` are excluded before aggregation.  
- USCS/CDC WONDER may suppress case counts or rates for states/years with small counts. Suppressed values are imported as missing (`NaN`) and not imputed; any downstream modeling should treat them accordingly.  
- The final merged dataset omits territories and records only the 50 states + DC.

### 2.2 Weighting and Aggregation

- `obesity_rate` and `smoking_rate` are computed using BRFSS-provided survey weights to approximate state-level adult populations.  
- Rates are stored as percentages (e.g., `31.4` = 31.4% of adults).  
- Incidence rates (`incidence_rate_adj`) are already age-adjusted and standardized by USCS (per 100,000).

### 2.3 Intended Use

This dataset is intended for:

- Exploratory analysis of behavioral risk factors and colorectal cancer incidence at the state level.  
- Teaching examples in data curation, epidemiology, and public health analytics.  
- Demonstrations of reproducible data pipelines using public data sources.

The dataset is **not** suitable for:

- Individual-level risk estimation.  
- Fine-grained spatial analysis (e.g., county or census tract).  
- Clinical decision-making.

## 3. Provenance

- `obesity_rate` and `smoking_rate` were generated by `scripts/brfss_2022_state_summary.py` from `LLCP2022.XPT`.  
- `incidence_rate_adj` and `incidence_cases` were generated by `scripts/cdc_colon_state_summaries.py` from a USCS 1999–2022 WONDER export.  
- All variables were merged and harmonized in `scripts/combine_state_summaries.py`.
